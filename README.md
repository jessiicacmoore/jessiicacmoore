# Hi I'm Jessica, but you can call me Jess ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ **Frontend Developer | Mentor | Accessibility Advocate | Driving Performance and Collaboration**

A fullstack developer with a frontend focus - I'm passionate about creating accessible, user-centered experiences. Since transitioning from marketing to web development in 2019, Iâ€™ve quickly progressed from a web developer role to leading a team, mentoring developers, and championing best practices. I specialize in React, JavaScript, and CSS/SASS, building seamless, inclusive interfaces.
